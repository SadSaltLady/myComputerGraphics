Pathtracer:
Task 1 - Generating Camera Rays: Fully implemented
Task 2 - Intersecting Triangles and Spheres: fully implemented
Task 3 - Implementing a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH): fully implemented 
    (although it is not optimized by indepth traversal, 
    so please use smaller ray amounts when testing, like 8 or something)
Task 4 - Implementing Shadow Rays: 8
not fully implemented
everywhere it's not supposed to hit it's returning a hit. Somehow I have it completely
backwards, but reversing how I'm checking for ray hits doesn't solve the problem. s

in Pathtracer.cpp line 121 it really should be "if (!shadowhit.hit) {...", but if I set it like that nothing renders
So now I know it's wrong, it doesn't render cast shadows (and renders them as light patches), but that's what I have
